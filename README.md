  * Social Psychology, Fourth Canadian Edition, is the market-leading textbook in Social Psychology. The Fourth Canadian Edition builds on the success of its predecessor by updating and clarifying content and adding features to make the material as relevant as possible for today's students and instructors. The text's three-part structure-Social Thinking, Social Influence, Social Relations—provides a framework to organize and apply core social psychological concepts, themes, and issues, and the four applied modules at the end of the text guide readers through an investigation of how social psychology functions in the real world. In a true co-author partnership, American author David Myers and our Canadian authors Steven Spencer and Christian Jordan provide a tightly integrated, well-presented, and highly readable text.
